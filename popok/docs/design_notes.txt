=======================
Note: this implementiation is specific to plasa.com

+ POP3 Client normal flow:
	1. connect to pop3 server port 110
	2. USER $username, send username
	3. PASS $pass, send password
	4. STAT, to get 1 line desribing: total email count, total email size
	5. LIST, to get each email's size
	6. RETR $num, to get email indiciated by the index (repeated until STAT email count)
	7. DELE $num, delete email indicated by the index (following RETR)
	8. back to 6 until last email
	9. QUIT, to send indication that pop3 client will immediately disconnect
	10. disconnect

+ Webmail flow:
	1. AUTHENTICATE, do HTTP post username/pass, Receive:
		- failed response
		- success response, with a cookie string
	2. GET LIST, do HTTP get (with cookie) to inbox file, parse to receive:
		- total email count
		- size
		- url to email content (in case plasa.com, we will use specific url to display email's raw format, and the url format is predictable and only depends on a number, parseable from each <input> variable.
		Also if more email is available, go the next page and do the same
	3. GET EMAIL, do HTTP get (with cookie) to each url collected previously
		this url pointed to raw version of email, which require no parsing and can be piped directly to pop3 client
	4. DELETE EMAIL, do HTTP get/post (with cookie) using list of email index previously received
	5. LOGOUT, do HTTP get (with cookie) to specific URL to logout
	

+ PWG (single thread, single user solution):
	1. client connect to pop3 server port 110
		- PWG receive, and wait for client sending USER
	2. USER $username, send username
		- PWG receive, store the username, and send +OK
	3. PASS $pass, send password
		- PWG receive, store the password, and:
			- do HTTP post with the username/password
			- parse response to indicate whether success/fail
			- if success, store cookies string, and send +OK
			- if fail, send +ERR
	4. STAT, to get 1 line desribing: total email count, total email size
		- PWG receive, and do GET LIST, store the email list information into dictionary, and return +OK with the email count, and their total size
	5. LIST, to get each email's size
		- PWG receive, and directly return +OK with email list from dictionary
	6. RETR $num, to get email indiciated by the index (repeated until STAT email count)
		- PWG receive, and do GET EMAIL. Response with +OK with raw email content
	7. DELE $num, delete email indicated by the index (following RETR)
		- PWG receive, and tag the indicated email index in the dictionary, for deleting. Response with +OK
	8. back to 6 until last email
	9. QUIT, to send indication that pop3 client will immediately disconnect
		- PWG receive, and do DELETE EMAIL for the previously tagged email, 
		- and do LOGOUT, and response with +OK --> not mandatory
	10. disconnect
		- PWG also disconnect, ready for new connection
