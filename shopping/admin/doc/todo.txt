Al-Admin Todo
=============
Note:
not all feature is applicable since al-admin is targeted for:
    - all GUI based browser with probably...
    - different javascript implementation
    - no activeX
    - no java applet
    - multiplatform
    - slow/high delay internet link
    - no image
    - phpmyadmin style requirement. since phpmyadmin is used by a lot of people, by setting phpmyadmin as benchmark, we could duplicate something it's doing right.

From tsunami:
- red-color callback
- single/multiple jargon replacement for form/table
- better welcome page
- replace combo-style nav menu with horizontal tab-style menu
X "multi-program instance" concept <- naah, will be slow, since "task changing" requires a req/resp. better to open two browser.
- main menu on top, next to logo, support
- log out on top right
- when opening program, by default, on new mode
- date lov button for date field
- date mask
- single mode: delete button
- single mode: refresh button
- single mode: new button
- change mode button
- change all task combo-style into button
- single: red background on error field
- multiple: red background on error cell
- multiple: pink background on error row
- "processing request" dialog box with hour glass animated gif, when user click
- multiple: on hover on row, change colour
- first open program behaviour di-attach ke menu item property, instead of directly on program. first open program behaviour:
    - single/multiple view
    - new/populate/query/
- additional menu item property
    - hidden on welcome menu
    - hidden on menubar
    - hidden on browser client
    - hidden on windows client
- defered combo content: combo value is populated the first time it's used
- field masking should be enabled, please please...
- good idea on a "Transaction" components:
    - Transaction
        - Region (Has many types: Frame, VerticalTile, HorizontalTile, RegionNotebook, InstanceNotebook, InstanceNavigator, SingleRegion, StandardGrid, TransposedGrid, HyperGrid)
            - Fields
            - Buttons
- context-help ala wiki !!!!
    - need more details here...
X checkbox widget should not be forced to be bool datatype. Naah. Tsunami force value to be char 'Y' or 'N'
- GraphicField widget. display graphic jpg/bmp/gif/png.if datatype is char, treat it as path to file. if datatype blob, treat it as the content of the graphic file.
- AnyFile widget.
    - on normal mode: show filename+extension, right click show Insert.., Open, Delete
    - on insert mode: show empty, right click show Insert...
    - Insert action: pop file browser, get path, depending on file datatype:
        - character: save file path, display the filename+Extension component (and on windows, get the associated icon of the extension and display it next to the filename)
        - blob: save file
- application abbrevation is used as table prefix.
    - good idea to differentiate multi application.
    - tsunami store application specific tables in "tsunami_appl" database
    - good idea, to avoid adding a column to store application abbrevation on ALL table
- store internal tables used by tsunami in separate database, so user do not mess with the db
    -
- store default internal column for each table:
    - creation_date_time
    - created_by -> int, conserve space
    - last_update_date_time
    - last_updated_by -> int, conserve space
    - last_updating_process
    - id_id -> similar to rowid
