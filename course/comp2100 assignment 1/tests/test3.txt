This is the abstract. This article should test everything in the
assignment. This article has a much longer abstract than the
other one did. Much, much, much longer. Itâ€™s really, really
long. Who would have thought that an abstract could be this
long?

Introduction

This is a paragraph with style â€œInitial Body Textâ€?. Here is
a span in italics and here is a span in boldface. This paragraph
is long so that we can check that the line breaking algorithm
works correctly in the text renderer.

This is a paragraph with style â€œText Bodyâ€?. The first line
should be indented by 2ems, but near enough is good enough. Here
is a span in italics and here is a span in boldface. This
paragraph is long so that we can check that the line breaking
algorithm works correctly in the text renderer.

Here is a hyperlink to the COMP2100 Home Page. Here is an inline
quotation in â€œcurly quotesâ€?.

Here is a block quotation that should be in a separate paragraph
with narrower margins. Letâ€™s make it quite a long quotation so
we can see those margins in action.
