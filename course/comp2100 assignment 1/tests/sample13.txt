Contiguous ordered lists?

Ian Barnes and Alexei Khorev

The Australian National University

This sample document tests whether the processor handles two
contiguous lists numbering correctly, ie, if the last item of
the first list is separated by an empty paragraph from the first
item of the second list, the first item on the second list must
have a number which follows the number of the last item on the
first list. 

Now let's see how the two adjacent ordered lists are handled.

 1. Sun shine.

 2. Moon light.

 3. Good time.

 4. Boogie.
