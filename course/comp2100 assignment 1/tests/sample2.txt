This research investigates the role of interface manipulation
style on reflective cognition and concept learning through
comparison of the effectiveness of three versions of a software
application for learning two-dimensional transformation
geometry. The three versions, respectively, utilize a Direct
Object Manipulation (DOM) interface - in which the user
manipulates the visual representation of objects being
transformed; a Direct Concept Manipulation (DCM) interface - in
which the user manipulates the visual representation of the
transfroamtion being applied to the object; and a Reflective
Direct Concept Manipulation (RDCM) interface - in which the DCM
approach is extended with scaffolding.

1. INTRODUCTION 

A great deal of interface design research has been devoted to
determining mechanisms for making productivity tools ( e.g.,
word processors and drawing tools) easy to use and intuitive so
that users can perform a given task more smoothly and
efficiently. 

Hutchins et al. [1986] outline different aspects of
"directness."  They state:

The Gulf of Execution is bridged by making the commands and
mechanisms of the system match the thoughts and goals of the
user as much as possible. The Gulf of Evaluation is bridged by
making the output displays present a good Conceptual Model of
the system that is readily perceived, interpreted, and
evaluated.


The research presented in this paper addresses the following
questions arising in the preceding discussion:

 1. Is a shift from DOM to DCM conducive to effective
    learning?

 2. Does DCM afford more reflective cognition and concious
    processing of concepts?

 3. How can the interface support reflective cognition, and
    are there scaffolding strategies that would support and
    enhance the DCM metaphor?

2. PRIMARY HEAD

2.1 Secondary Head

In the DOM version, the user manipulates the geometric shapes
directly. Buttons on the side allow users to select drag,
clockwise rotate, counter-clockwise rotate, horizontal flip, or
vertical flip mode (see Figure 5).

2.1.1 Tertiary Head. This can be illustrated by the following
equation:

TAttempt (m) = TOverread(m) + R(m) . TIntput(m)    (2)

Table II shows mean pretest scores were at about the same level
for all the groups. However, the results show large gains for
the RDCM treatment group.
