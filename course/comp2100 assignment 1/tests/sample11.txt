Contiguous ordered lists?
(I don't think so)

This sample document tests whether the processor handles two
contiguous lists numbering correctly, ie, if the last item of
the first list is separated by an empty paragraph from the first
item of the second list, the first item on the second list must
have a number which follows the number of the last item on the
first list. 1©Ian Barnes and Alexei Khorev, ANU FEIT DCS 2006


Now let's see how the two adjacent ordered lists are handled.

 1. Sun shine.

 2. Moon light.

 3. Good time.

 4. Boogie.

__________________________________  

 1. The previous paragraph contained only white spaces.

 2. How will item of this list be numbered?

Now we are out of the ordered list for good.

How about weeding out hyphen-only paragraphs:

--------------------------------------  

and underscore-only paragraphs:

_______________________________

and a mixed one:

_________________--------------------_______________

and the last one (also tricky):

_________________________________________

so? what do you think?
