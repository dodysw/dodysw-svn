Spaces removed that shouldnâ€™t be

This sample document tests whether the processor removes data
elements that consist only of white space correctly, or if it
removes some that it shouldnâ€™t.

Plain italic bold plain.

In that first paragraph, there should be a space between the
words â€œitalicâ€? and â€œboldâ€?.

There should be no white space between the parts of the word
â€œUnbelievable!â€? Neither should there be spaces between the
initial letters and the rest of the names: Bertrand Meyer, 
Larry Wall, and Niklaus Wirth. (Of course it would have made
much more sense to have the entire name in caps & small caps,
like this: Bertrand Meyer, But thatâ€™s not the way the ACM
template does it. Look at the reference list in sample2.sxw.)
