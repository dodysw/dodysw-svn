1. INTRODUCTION 

This is the first paragraph of the introduction. It needs to be
long enough to have more than one line, otherwise it looks
funny.

This is the second paragraph. According to the template, its
first line should be indented, but the other lines should not.

The third and subsequent paragraphs should be formatted the same
as the second one.

2. The second section

Here is the text of the second section. It has a list of bullet
points in it.

  o This is the first point.

  o This is the second point.

    This bullet point has two paragraphs, of which this is
    the second.

  o Here is the third, and last, point.

Here is some more text that follows the list. The first line of
this paragraph should not be indented.

3. The third section

This section is just here to pad out the document so that it
runs over the page. Notice how the footnote goes across the page
break. Perhaps it was a

proper footnote in Word and it's just Open Office that has
stuffed it up. Notice how this paragraph is split too, when it
should be all part of the one paragraph. We cannot fix that
here.
